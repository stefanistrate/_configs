Settings for various tools I use frequently.

[`managed/*`](managed) config files can be installed and updated via the
[`install`](install) script.

[`unmanaged/*`](unmanaged) config files have to be loaded manually into their
corresponding tools.

A couple of configs in this repository were imported or adapted from other
sources. Many thanks to their original developers!
